Spam-Mail-Detection
</h1>
The main purpose of this project is to perform simple classification problems. The dataset has been taken from UCI Machine learning repository which has labeling emails as spam or non-spam, based on their content in terms of words. K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision tree were performed in this project.
<br>
<br>
The Models have been tested with and without <b>Principal Component Analysis</b>
